0.  How many different colors does each format support?
    Answer: 
        BMP: 32 bit color
    	GIF: 8 bits
    	JPEG: 24 bit
    	PNG: 24 bit
1.  Which of the formats supports animation?
     Answer: 
        GIF
2.  What’s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
    Answer:
        lossless: no info loss after compression
        lossy: reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information, especially redundant information
3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
     Answer:
        JPEG
4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
    Answer:
    First, the system modifies the filename’s first
    character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file
    has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
    Second,  the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters
    to the hard drive’s list of free clusters
5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
    Answer:
        by deleting and overwritting the space where the file was with other datas
6.  What’s stdint.h?
    Answer: stdint.h is a header file that will declare sets of integer having
            specified width
7.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    Answer:
        uint8_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 8 bits.
        uint32_t denotes a unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 32 bits.
        int32_t denotes a signed integer type with a width of exactly 8 bits.
        uint16_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 16 bits.
    
8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    Answer:
        BYTE - 8 bits
        DWORD - 32 bits (unsigned integer)
        LONG  - 32 bits (signed integer)
        WORD  - 16-bit (unsigned integer)
9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? (Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
    Answer:
        ASCII - BM
        hexadecimal - 0x
10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    Answer:
        bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file,
        biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER header file
11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    Answer:
        If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    Answer:
       biBitCount Specifies the number of bits per pixel
13.  Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
    Answer:
        if the OS is out of memory, 
        or if we try to access a file in a directory without proper permission
14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    Answer:
        because we are dealing with only one element
15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    Answer:
        0;
16. What does fseek do?
    Answer:
         fseek, allows you to change the location of the file pointer.,
         
17. What is SEEK_CUR?
    Answer: 
        is an integer constant which specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position
